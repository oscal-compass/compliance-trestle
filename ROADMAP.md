# Roadmap

The [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/oscal-compass/projects/2) for Trestle is published as a GitHub project board.

This project serves as the up-to-date description of high-level initiatives and issues that have been reviewed and identified as valuable to the community.

High level roadmap items are identified as `Epics`. These represent larger initiatives that need design collaboration and will result in issues representing individual features.

**Please take any defined dates as estimations and not strict commitments to a delivery timeline.**

### How to get involved

Each roadmap item is represented as a GitHub issue. Discussions or any feedback on current roadmap items can take place in threads on the corresponding issue. To stay up-to-date with roadmap items, please join the OSCAL-Compass community [meetings](https://github.com/oscal-compass/community).

### How to add an item to the roadmap?

New items on the roadmap are typically driven by changes in OSCAL and new feature requests through GitHub issues.
During issue triage, feature requests are identified as `Epics` and added to the roadmap or individual features that can be directly added to the project `Backlog` and/or an upcoming release milestone.
