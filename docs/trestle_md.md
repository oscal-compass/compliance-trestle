# trestle CLI for governance of markdown documents

## Overview

The premise of trestle is to support managing compliance artifacts as code.
When this is considered, many organisations using `{github|gitlab|bitbucket}` rely on markdown documents for documentary artifacts that may either directly or indirectly support compliance efforts.

To support this trestle has the concept of 'governing' markdown documents: Where structural conditions are enforced on the markdown documents to allow automation and to ensure business processes are met.

Anticipate that further capability is added to this space as content evolves over time.

## Structural enforcement mechanisms

In order for trestle to enforce structure an approach has been taken for how to template markdown documents. There are two mechanism that are enforced:

1. Enforcing a heading structure within the markdown document:
1. Enforcing a structured header within the markdown document either by using yaml headers or a designated heading.

For enforcing the heading structure the mechanism used is the following:

Markdown headings `As an example` are considered to be nested based on the heading level (e.g. ` heading` is below ` top level heading`).

For a document to contain the structural requirements it must contain all the headings provided in the template, however, can contain additional nested templates. Given this template:

```markdown
# Template heading 1

# Template heading 2
## Template sub heading
```

The following document is acceptable:

```markdown
# Template heading 1
Content for heading one
## Non-required sub header
Content for non-required sub header
# Template heading 2
Content for heading two
## Template sub heading
Content for template sub heading
### non required sub-sub heading
This sub-sub heading is okay
```

However, violations such as adding or removing a heading at a level that has been templated is not acceptable e.g.:

```markdown
# Template heading 1
Content for heading one
## Non-required sub header
Content for non-required sub header
# Template heading 2
Content for heading two
## Template sub heading
Content for template sub heading
## sub heading that violates template
This sub heading is NOT okay
# Top level heading that is not okay
```

For each of the headings - the text of the heading is enforced with one caveat:

- If the template heading text is wrapped in curly brackets `{}` then the name is not measured e.g. `# {Insert title here}`.

### Strict header / heading conformance mechanisms

Two mechanisms are provided to enforce metadata within markdown documents. The first is the yaml header, as used by technologies such as jekyll, the second is a markdown 'governed heading\` where templating of the content is enforced.
Use of the yaml header is strongly encouraged as a first preference.

```markdown
---
yaml:
    header:
        - with some 
        - structure
    more: information
---
# The rest of my document
```

The yaml header is structurally enforced my measuring whether the template key structure is reflected in the measured document. It does not measure values for yaml attributes. For the above markdown document the array value for `yaml.header` could be replaced with a single value or expanded. Enforcing the yaml header is enabled by `-hv` where available.

For enforcing a governed heading the structural enforcement mechanism assumes that the `key:value` structure simply takes the form that following that for each line of content under the chosen heading the template content is a subset of the measured document, in the order provided in the template. This is performed after removing formatting (such as bolding), and any HTML comments.

Given:

```markdown
# heading for strict enforcement
my_key:
**my_key_2:**
my_other key with strange stuff??
```

The following heading would be acceptable.

```markdown
# heading for strict enforcement
my_key: my value
my_key_2: my value
my_other key with strange stuff?? my value
```

This capability, where available, is activated by `--governed-heading` or `-gh`

## `trestle md governed-docs`

Governed docs is designed to support enforcing and generating templating markdown files within a single folder based on
a task name.

`trestle md governed-docs setup -tn my_task_name` Create the necessary directory structures for running governed docs validation.
A template file will be created in `TRESTLE_ROOT/.trestle/md/my_task_name/template.md` and be applied to all markdown files here: `TRESTLE_ROOT/my_task_name/*.md`.

`trestle md governed-docs create-sample -tn my_task_name` Creates a sample file in `TRESTLE_ROOT/my_task_name/`

`trestle md governed-docs template-validate -tn my_task_name` Ensures that the markdown is parseable. If `--governed-heading 'heading name'` is passed it ensures that the required heading exists.

`trestle md governed-docs validate -tn my_task_name` validates the markdown, optionally with a `--governed-heading` or `-hv` yaml header based on this `TRESTLE_ROOT/.trestle/md/my_task_name/template.md` template to all markdown files here: `TRESTLE_ROOT/my_task_name/*.md`.

## `trestle md` governed-folders

Governed-folders is designed to allow the assembly of groups of templates where the folder assembly is the unique instance.

For example given the following template setup using `trestle md governed-docs setup -tn my_task_2`

```
trestle_root
 ┣ .trestle
 ┃ ┣ md
 ┃ ┃ ┗ my_task_2
 ┃ ┃ ┃ ┣ a_template.md
 ┃ ┃ ┃ ┗ another_template.md
 ┃ ┗ config.ini
```

Each task folder is required to meet template requirements for both `a_template.md` and `another_template.md`.
The names, numbers, and nesting of folders is arbitrary.

Following the similar structure of `governed-docs`, measurement occurs in the `my_task_2` where this structure is enforced for every directory.

```
trestle_root
 ┣ .trestle
 ┣ my_task_2
 ┃ ┣ User_chosen_name
 ┃ ┃ ┣ a_template.md
 ┃ ┃ ┗ another_template.md
 ┃ ┗ Second_user_chosen_name
 ┃ ┃ ┣ a_template.md
 ┃ ┃ ┗ another_template.md
```
