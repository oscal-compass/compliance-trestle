# trestle CLI Overview and OSCAL Usecases

The trestle CLI has three primary use cases:

- Serve as tooling to generate and manipulate OSCAL files directly by an end user. The objective is to reduce the complexity of creating and editing workflows. Example commands are: `trestle import`, `trestle create`, `trestle add`, `trestle split`, `trestle merge`.
- Act as an automation tool that, by design, can be an integral part of a CI/CD pipeline e.g. `trestle validate`, `trestle tasks`.
- Allow governance of markdown documents so they conform to specific style or structure requirements.

To support each of these use cases trestle creates an opinionated directory structure to manage governed documents.

## Opinionated directory structure

Trestle relies on an opinionated directory structure, similar to `git`, `go`, or `auditree`, to manage the workflow. Most trestle commands are restricted to working within an initialized directory tree.

The directory structure setup by trestle has three major elements:

- A `.trestle` hidden folder.
- A `dist` folder.
- Folders for each of the OSCAL schemas.

The outline of the schema is below:

```
.
├── .trestle
├── dist
│   ├── catalogs
│   ├── profiles
│   ├── system-security-plans
│   ├── assessment-plans
│   ├── assessment-results
│   └── plan-of-action-and-milestones
├── catalogs
├── profiles
├── component-definitions
├── system-security-plans
├── assessment-plans
├── assessment-results
└── plan-of-action-and-milestones
```

`.trestle` directory is a special directory containing various trestle artefacts to help run various other commands. Examples include configuration files, caches and templates.

The bulk of the folder structure is used to represent each of the *top level schemas* or *top level models* such as `catalogs` and `profiles`. For each of these directories the following root structure is maintained:

```

├── .trestle
└── TOP_LEVEL_MODEL_PLURAL
    └── NAME_OF_MODEL_INSTANCE
        └── TOP_LEVEL_MODEL_NAME.{json,yaml,yml}

```

which appears, for a catalog a user decides is titled nist-800-53, as:

```
├── .trestle
└── catalogs
    └── nist-800-53
        └── catalog.json

```

`dist` directory will contain the assembled version of the models located on the source model directories (at the project root level) which are: `catalogs`, `profiles`, `component-definitions`, `system-security-plans`, `assessment-plans`, `assessment-results` and `plan-of-action-and-milestones`. The assumption is that each of the OSCAL files within this folder is ready to be read by external 3rd party tools.

### Support for subdivided document structures

The files constructed by OSCAL can run into the tens of thousands of lines of yaml or formatted json. At this size the
files become completely unmanageable for users. To combat this, trestle can `trestle split` a file into many smaller files and later merge those split files together.

Directory structures such as the one below can represent OSCAL document structures. Users are strongly encourage to rely on split and merge to code these structures.

Users can query the contents of files using `trestle describe`, and probe the contents more deeply using it in combination with element paths.

```
.
├── .trestle
├── dist 
│   └── catalogs
│       └── nist800-53.json 
└── catalogs
    └── nist800-53
        ├── catalog.json
        └── catalog
            ├── metadata.json
            ├── metadata
            │   ├── revision-history
            │   │   ├── 00000__revision-history.json
            │   │   ├── 00001__revision-history.json
            │   │   └── 00002__revision-history.json   
            │   └── responsible-parties
            │       ├── creator__responsible-party.json
            │       └── contact__responsible-party.json       
            └── groups
                ├── 00000__group.json        
                ├── 00000__group
                │   └── controls
                │       ├── 00000__control.json
                │       └── 00001__control.json
                ├── 00001__group.json 
                └── 00001__group
                    └── controls
                        ├── 00000__control.json
                        └── 00001__control.json
...
```

## `trestle init`

This command will create a trestle project in the current directory with the necessary directory structure and trestle artefacts. For example, if we run `trestle init` in a directory, it will create the directory structure below for different artefacts:

```
.
├── .trestle
├── dist
│   ├── catalogs
│   ├── profiles
│   ├── system-security-plans
│   ├── assessment-plans
│   ├── assessment-results
│   └── plan-of-action-and-milestones
├── catalogs
├── profiles
├── component-definitions
├── system-security-plans
├── assessment-plans
├── assessment-results
└── plan-of-action-and-milestones
```

`.trestle` directory is a special directory containing various trestle artefacts to help run various other commands.

`dist` directory will contain the merged or assembled version of the models located on the source model directories (at the project root level) which are: `catalogs`, `profiles`, `component-definitions`, `system-security-plans`, `assessment-plans`, `assessment-results` and `plan-of-action-and-milestones`.

Notice that trestle is a highly opinionated tool and, therefore, the names of the files and directories that are created by any of the `trestle` commands and subcommands MUST NOT be changed manually.

## `trestle create`

This command will create a bare-bones sample file for one of the OSCAL models.  For example, `trestle create catalog -o nist800-53` will create a sample catalog file, `catalog.json` in the catalog subdirectory, `nist800-53` as shown below:

```
.
├── .trestle
└── catalogs
    └── nist800-53
        └── catalog.json
...
```

The following subcommands are currently supported:

- `trestle create catalog`: creates a directory structure containing a sample OSCAL catalog model under the `catalogs` folder.
- `trestle create profile`: creates a directory structure containing a sample OSCAL profile model under the `profiles` folder.
- `trestle create component-definition`: creates a directory structure containing a sample component-definition model under the `component-definitions` folder.
- `trestle create system-security-plan`: creates a directory structure containing a sample system-security-plan model under the `system-security-plans` folder.
- `trestle create assessment-plan`: creates a directory structure containing a sample assessment-plan under the `assessment-plans` folder.
- `trestle create assessment-result`: creates a directory structure containing a sample assessment-result under the `assessment-results` folder.
- `trestle create plan-of-action-and-milestone`: creates a directory structure containing a sample plan-of-action-and-milestone under the `plan-of-action-and-milestones` folder.

The following options are supported:

- `-o or --output`: specifies the name/alias of a model. It is used as the prefix for the output filename under the `dist` directory and for naming the source subdirectories under  `catalogs`, `profiles`, `component-definitions`, `system-security-plans`, `assessment-plans`, `assessment-results` or `plan-of-action-and-milestones`.

The user can edit the parts of the generated OSCAL model by modifying the sample content in those directories.

The initial level of decomposition of each type of model varies according to the model type.
This default or reference decomposition behaviour can be changed by modifying the rules in a `.trestle/config file`. These rules can be written as a sequence of `trestle split` commands.

Passing `-iof` or `--include-optional-fields` will make `trestle create` generate a richer model containing all optional fields until finding recursion in the model (e.g controls within control).

## `trestle import`

This command allows users to import existing OSCAL files so that they can be managed using trestle. For example `trestle import -f /local_dir/existing_catalog.json -o my_existing_catalog` will import `existing_catalog.json` into a new folder under `catalogs` as shown below:

```
.
├── .trestle
└── catalogs
    └── my_existing_catalog
        └── catalog.json
...
```

The following options are supported:

- `-f or --file`: specifies the path of an existing OSCAL file or URL to a remote file.
- `-o or --output`: specifies the name/alias of a model. It is used as the prefix for the output filename under the `dist` directory and for naming the source subdirectories under  `catalogs`, `profiles`, `component-definitions`, `system-security-plans`, `assessment-plans`, `assessment-results` or `plan-of-action-and-milestones`.

The `--file` option may be an absolute or relative path, and it may be a URL.  For details on allowed formats please see the documentation for the `href` command.  The file must be imported from outside the current trestle directory or an error will result.

The import subcommand can determine the type of the model that is to be imported by the contents of the file.  But the file name must end with an allowed json or yaml extension: `.json, .yaml, .yml`

During the import process the file must pass the `validate` test described below for the command, `validate`.  If the file does not pass validation a warning will be given describing the nature of the problem and the import will fail.

Once a file has been imported it can be split into a rich tree of sub-components as shown at the top of this document.  But the file must be imported first.

## `trestle replicate`

This command allows users to replicate a certain OSCAL model (file and directory structure). For example `trestle replicate catalog -i cat1 -o cat11` will replicate the Catalog cat1 into `cat11` directory. It can also regenerate all the UUIDs as required.

## `trestle split`

This command allows users to further decompose a trestle model into additional subcomponents.

The following options are currently supported:

- `-f or --file`: this is optional and specifies the file path of the json/yaml file containing the elements that will be split.
- `-e or --elements`: specifies the model subcomponent element(s) (JSON/YAML property path) that is/are going to be split. Multiple elements can be specified at once using a comma-separated value, e.g `-e 'catalog.metadata,catalog.groups'`.  Make sure to include the quotes that enclose the comma-separated paths.

If the element is of JSON/YAML type array list and you want trestle to create a separate subcomponent file per array item, the element needs to be suffixed with `.*`, e.g. `-e 'catalog.groups.*'`. If the suffix is not specified, split will place all array items in only one separate subcomponent file, e.g. `'groups.json'`.  Again, make sure to include the quotes around the elements.

If you just want to split a file into all its constituent parts and the file does not contain a simple list of objects, you can still use `*` and the file will be split into all its non-trivial elements.  Thus if you split a catalog with `-e catalog.*` the result will be a new directory, `catalog`, containing files representing the large items, `back-matter.json, groups.json and metadata.json`, but there will still be a `catalog.json` file containing just the catalog's `uuid`.  Small items such as strings and dates cannot be split off and will remain in the original model file that is being split.

Here are some examples.  Starting with a single catalog file, `my_catalog/catalog.json`, if we do `trestle split -f catalog.json -e 'catalog.*'` we end up with:

```
catalogs
 ┗ my_catalog
 ┃ ┣ catalog
 ┃ ┃ ┣ back-matter.json
 ┃ ┃ ┣ groups.json
 ┃ ┃ ┗ metadata.json
 ┃ ┗ catalog.json
```

If I then split roles out of metadata as a single file containing a list of roles, `trestle split -f catalog/metadata.json -e 'metadata.roles'` I would end up with:

```
catalogs
 ┗ my_catalog
 ┃ ┣ catalog
 ┃ ┃ ┣ metadata
 ┃ ┃ ┃ ┗ roles.json
 ┃ ┃ ┣ back-matter.json
 ┃ ┃ ┣ groups.json
 ┃ ┃ ┗ metadata.json
 ┃ ┗ catalog.json
```

If instead I had specified `-e 'metadata.roles.*'` I would get:

```
my_catalog
 ┣ catalog
 ┃ ┣ metadata
 ┃ ┃ ┗ roles
 ┃ ┃ ┃ ┣ 00000__role.json
 ┃ ┃ ┃ ┗ 00001__role.json
 ┃ ┣ back-matter.json
 ┃ ┣ groups.json
 ┃ ┗ metadata.json
 ┗ catalog.json
```

You can see there is no `roles.json` file anymore and instead there is a subdirectory, `roles` containing a list of files, one for each `role`.

If the `-f or --file` option is not specified, the file to split will be determined from the elements specified, in the context of the current working directory.  The current directory must be
within a specific model (e.g. `catalog` or `profile`), and the element paths must either be absolute (e.g. `catalog.metadata.roles`) or relative to the current working directory.  For example, if you are in `catalogs/mycat/catalog/groups` and you want to split the file `00000__group.json`, you must use `-f` to specify the filename, and the element path can either be absolute, as `catalog.group.*`, or you can set the current working directory to where the file is and use element path `group.*`.  This makes it easier to specify splits when deep in a directory structure.

Every subdirectory in a trestle directory model should have a corresponding `.json` or `.yaml` file with the same name, except when that subdirectory corresponds to a list of items, such as `catalog.groups`. When those subcomponents are split/expanded each file or subdirectory under them represents an item of the collection. Because of that, if a corresponding `groups.json | groups.yaml` file were to exist, its contents would just be an empty representation of that collection and the user would need to be careful never to edit that file. Therefore, we decided not to create that corresponding file in those cases. Following the same logic, another exception is when all the fields from a `.json | .yaml` file are split, leaving the original file as an empty object. In that case, the file would be deleted as well.

To inspect a file to see what elements can be split from it, use the `describe` command described below.  It is also useful for inspection of files created by the split operation.

## `trestle merge`

The trestle merge command is the reversal of `trestle split`. This command allows users to reverse the decomposition of a trestle model by aggregating subcomponents scattered across multiple files or directories into the parent JSON/YAML file.
To merge a model, you have to first change working directory to the root model component directory that you want to merge a sub-component model into.
The following option is required:

- `-e or --elements`: specifies the properties (JSON/YAML path) that will be merged, relative to the current working directory. This must contain at least 2 elements, where the last element is the model/sub-component to be merged into the second from last component.

For example, in the command `trestle merge -e 'catalog.metadata'`, executed in the same directory where `catalog.json` or the split `catalog` directory exists, the property `metadata` from `metadata.json` or `metadata.yaml` would be moved/merged into `catalog.json`.
If the `metadata` model has already been split into smaller sub-component models previously, those smaller sub-components are first recusively merged into `metadata`, before merging `metadata` subcomponent into `catalog.json`. To specify merging every sub-component
split from a component, `.*` can be used. For example, `trestle merge -e 'catalog.*'` command, issued from the directory where `catalog.json` or`catalog` directory exists, will merge every single sub-component of that catalog back into the `catalog.json`.

## `trestle describe`

This command lets users inspect model files to explore contents using an optional element path.  The command can work well in concert with `split` to show what each file contains, and probe within the contents to determine sub-components that can be extracted as separate files.

Unlike split, describe only describes the contents of a single item, so the element path may not contain wildcards (`*`) or commas.

For example, if a catalog file has been imported to `catalogs/my_catalog/catalog.json` then the commmand, `trestle describe -f catalog.json` might yield:

```
Model file catalog.json is of type catalog.Catalog and contains:
    uuid: 613fca2d-704a-42e7-8e2b-b206fb92b456
    metadata: common.Metadata
    params: None
    controls: None
    groups: list of 20 items of type catalog.Group
    back_matter: common.BackMatter
```

Note that contents are listed even when they are empty (and therefore optional) so the full potential contents can be seen.  Also note that if an item corresponds to a list of elements, the number and type of elements is provided.  Finally, if an item is a simple string such as `id`, `uuid` or `title`, the string is shown directly up to a maximum of 100 characters.  If the string is clipped it will be indicated by `[truncated]` at the end of the string.

An element path can be specified to probe the contents, as in `trestle describe -f catalog.json -e 'catalog.metadata.roles'`.  A possible response is:

```
Model file catalog.json at element path catalog.metadata.roles is a list of 2 items of type common.Role
```

You can also query individual elements, and elements of an element, e.g. `trestle describe -f catalog.json -e 'catalog.groups.5.controls.3'`

```
Model file catalog.json at element path catalog.groups.5.controls.3 is of type catalog.Control and contains:
    id: cp-4
    class_: SP800-53
    title: Contingency Plan Testing
    params: list of 2 items of type common.Parameter
    props: list of 2 items of type common.Property
    links: list of 14 items of type common.Link
    parts: list of 2 items of type common.Part
    controls: list of 5 items of type catalog.Control
```

(Note that the numbering starts at 0, so the `.3` corresponds to the 4th element.)

In all output from `describe` the type of the item shown corresponds to the python file and class of the corresponding OSCAL model in trestle.

If you split items off a model so they end up in a subdirectory, the original file is referred to as a "stripped" model, with parts of it stripped off and only some elements remaining.  For example, if you do `trestle split -f catalog.json -e 'catalog.metadata'` it will split off metadata from the original `catalog.json` file and place it in `catalog/metadata.json`.  If you then do `trestle describe -f catalog.json` on the new file, it will say something like:

```
Model file catalog.json is of type stripped.Catalog and contains:
    uuid: 613fca2d-704a-42e7-8e2b-b206fb92b456
    params: None
    controls: None
    groups: list of 20 items of type catalog.Group
    back_matter: common.BackMatter
```

Note that the type of the file is now `stripped.Catalog` and it no longer contains `metadata`.  Even though metadata is no longer in the original `.json` file, trestle is still aware it is present in the model since it is properly placed as its own file in the subdirectory, `catalog`.

## `trestle partial-object-validate`

OSCAL objects are extremely large. Some systems may only be able to produce partial OSCAL objects. For example
the tanium-to-oscal task produces the `results` attribute of an `assessment-results` object.

`trestle partial-object-validate` allows the validation of any sub-element/attribute using element path.

Using the example above `trestle partial-object-validate -f results.json -e asssesment-results.results`.

The file is not required to be in the trestle project or required to be a specific file name.

### Example valid element-paths

All element paths must be absolute e.g.:
`catalog.metadata`
`catalog`
`catalog.groups`
`catalog.groups.group.controls.control.controls.control`
Remembering in the end you only care about the end type. So in this scenario `catalog.groups.group.controls.control.controls.control` is equivalent to `catalog.controls.control`.

## `trestle href`

This command changes the href of an Import in a profile and is needed when generating an SSP (system security plan) with the author tool, `ssp-generate`.
The Imports in a profile are used to load associated catalogs of controls and profiles, and must be available at the corresponding href uri.  If an imported catalog is in the trestle directory then the href should be changed with a command of the form:

```
trestle href -n my_profile -hr trestle://catalogs/my_catalog/catalog.json
```

Similarly, if the item imported is a profile, a corresponding href should point to a json file in the `profiles` directory.

Note that catalogs or profiles in the trestle directory are indicated by the `trestle://` prefix, followed by the path from the trestle root directory to the actual
catalog file.  The profile itself, which is having its imports modified, is just indicated by its name with the `-n` option.

If the profile has more than one import, you can display the corresponding hrefs with:

```
trestle href -n my_profile
```

This will give a numbered list of the hrefs.  You can then change them individually by providing the corresponding item number:

```
trestle href -n my_profile -i 1 -hr trestle://catalogs/my_catalog/catalog.json
```

This will change the href indexed as `1` when the list was displayed.  The href's are indexed starting from 0.

The `trestle href` command can also be used to change the value back to the intended one prior to distribution of the profile.

The provided href can be of form `trestle://`, `https://`, `sftp://`, or `file:///`.  If `file:///` is used, the path provided must be absolute - and on Windows
it must include the drive letter followed by a slash.  The only time a relative path is allowed is with the `trestle://` heading.

A username and password may be embedded in the url for `https://`, and a CA certificate path will be searched from environment variables `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` and `CURL_CA_BUNDLE` in that order.

Authorization for `sftp://` access relies on the user's private key being either active via `ssh-agent` or supplied via the environment variable `SSH_KEY`. In the latter case it must not require a passphrase prompt.

## `trestle assemble`

This command assembles all contents (files and directories) representing a specific model into a single OSCAL file located under `dist` folder. For example,

`$TRESTLE_BASEDIR$ trestle assemble catalog -i nist800-53`

will traverse the `catalogs/nist800-53` directory and its children and combine all data into a OSCAL file that will be written to `dist/catalogs/nist800-53.json`. Note that the parts of catalog `nist800-53` can be written in either YAML/JSON/XML (e.g. based on the file extension), however, the output will be generated as YAML/JSON/XML as desired. Trestle will infer the content type from the file extension and create the model representation appropriately in memory and then output in the desired format. Trestle assemble will also validate content as it assembles the files and make sure the contents are syntactically correct.

## `trestle add`

This command allows users to add an OSCAL model to a subcomponent in source directory structure of the model. For example,

`$TRESTLE_BASEDIR/catalogs/nist800-53$ trestle add -f ./catalog.json -e catalog.metadata.roles `

will add the following property under the `metadata` property for a catalog that will be written to the appropriate file under `catalogs/nist800-53` directory:

```
"roles": [
  {
    "id": "REPLACE_ME",
    "title": "REPLACE_ME"
  }
```

Default values for mandatory datatypes will be like below. All UUID's will be populated by default whether or not they are mandatory.

```
- DateTime: <Current date-time>
- Boolean: False
- Integer: 0 
- String: REPLACE_ME
- Float/Double: 0.00
- Id field: Auto generated UUID
```

Passing `-iof` or `--include-optional-fields` will make `trestle add` generate a richer model containing all optional fields until finding recursion in the model (e.g controls within control).

## `trestle remove`

The trestle remove command is the reversal of `trestle add`.

## `trestle validate`

Trestle validate is designed to perform a function to ensure integrity of a set of OSCAL files. This can be as simple as
a schema validation within a single file or as complex as ensuring the integrity of a 'stack' of OSCAL files including potentially
remote system state.

Trestle validate the form \`trestle validate -f FILE -i SPECIFIC_ITEM_OR_VALUE

Trestle validates files according to a number of criteria, and it can operate on one or more files specified in different ways.

`validate` returns a non-zero return code if there is any validation problem detected in a file.

The current list of validation modes that get checked internally are:

| Mode          | Purpose                                                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| duplicates    | Identify if duplicate uuid's are present                              |
| oscal_version | Confirm that the oscal version of the file is supported               |
| refs          | Confirm that all references in responsible parties are found in roles |

In addition to validating a single file you can validate all files of a given type with the `-t` option:

`trestle validate -t catalog`

And you can validate all models with the `-a` option:

`trestle validate -a`

Finally, you can validate a model based on its name using the `-n` option, along with the type of the model:

`trestle validate -t catalog -n my_catalog`

Note that when you `Import` a file it will perform a full validation on it first, and if it does not pass validation the file cannot be imported.

## `trestle tasks`

Open Shift Compliance Operator and Tanium are supported as 3rd party tools.

## `trestle task osco-to-oscal`

The *trestle task osco-to-oscal* command facilitates transformation of OpenShift Compliance Operator (OSCO) scan results *.yaml* files into OSCAL partial results *.json* files. Specify required config parameters to indicate the location of the input and the output. Specify optional config parameters to indicate the name of the oscal-metadata.yaml file, if any, and whether overwriting of existing output is permitted.

**metadata format**

The *oscal_metadata.yaml* file comprises one or more mappings. Below is shown the
format of a single mapping. The items in angle brackets are to be replaced with
desired values for augmenting the produced OSCAL.

The mapping whose *<name>* matches the *\[metadata\]\[name\]* in the evidence for the
corresponding embedded XML, if any, will be used for augmenting the produced
OSCAL.
