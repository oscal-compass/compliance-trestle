The code of conduct now resides at the organization level in the community repository. Please visit https://github.com/oscal-compass/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md to review the common code of conduct.

Note: The code of conduct is subject to change as `compliance-trestle` is on-boarded as a CNFC sandbox project.
