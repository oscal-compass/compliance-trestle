## Pull requests instructions

Please, go through these steps before you submit a PR.

1. Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.

1. If not, then make sure that:

   a. You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the `fix/` or `feature/` prefixes. Good examples are: `fix/signin-issue` or `feature/issue-templates`.

   b. You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line).

   c. Please make sure that your branch passes tests before

1. **After** these steps, you're ready to open a pull request.

   a. Your pull request MUST NOT target the `main` branch on this repository. You probably want to target `develop` instead.

   b. Give a descriptive title to your PR.

   c. Provide a description of your changes.

   d. Put `closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close the issue that your PR fixes (if such).
