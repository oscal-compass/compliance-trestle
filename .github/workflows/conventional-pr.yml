          # For work-in-progress PRs you can typically use draft pull requests 
          # from Github. However, private repositories on the free plan don't have 
          # this option and therefore this action allows you to opt-in to using the 
          # special "[WIP]" prefix to indicate this state. This will avoid the 
          # validation of the PR title and the pull request checks remain pending.

          # merge commit, and it's easy to commit this by mistake. Enable this option
          # to also validate the commit
