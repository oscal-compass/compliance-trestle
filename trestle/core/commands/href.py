        """Change the href of the import in the profile to point to a catalog in a specific location.

        A Profile has an Imports list containing at least one href of a catalog or profile to be imported.
        If the item being referenced is currently in the same trestle project as the main profile, the original
        href is likely different from the one needed to access the item from the profile.  Therefore,
        in order for trestle to find the item directly from the profile, the href must be modified in a way that
        trestle can load it.

        If the item is already at the link referred to by the href as a valid URI or absolute file path then no
        change is needed.  But if the item is being worked on in the same trestle directory as the profile,
        the href should be modified to something like trestle://catalogs/my_catalog/catalog.json

        This change only needs to be made once to the profile while the profile is being used to generate SSP's
        from the local item, but if the final profile is released the href would need to be changed to the
        intended final location of the referenced item.

        Args:
            trestle_root: trestle_root for this call
            profile_name: Name of profile already imported into trestle containing href's to be changed
            new_href: New value for the href of the import.  If blank just list the hrefs
            import_num: Item number of the href to change.


        Returns:
            0 on success, 1 on failure

        Assumptions and requirements:
            The profile must be a valid profile in the trestle project.
            The import must either be a valid uri, including local file, or trestle://
            The original href is not checked and will be overwritten.
            If href is the empty string, just list all hrefs.

        Future work:
            Allow multiple imports with matching hrefs.
            Allow href to point to profile in trestle rather than catalog, and by name.
            Allow full chaining of linked catalogs and profiles.
