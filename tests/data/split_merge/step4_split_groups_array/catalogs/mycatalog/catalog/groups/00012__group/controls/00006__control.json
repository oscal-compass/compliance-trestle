The process of security and privacy requirements integration also embeds into the enterprise architecture and the organization\u2019s security and privacy architectures consistent with the organizational risk management strategy. For PM-7, security and privacy architectures are developed at a system-of-systems level, representing all organizational systems. For [PL-8](#pl-8), the security and privacy architectures are developed at a level that represents an individual system. The system-level architectures are consistent with the security and privacy architectures defined for the organization. Security and privacy requirements and control integration are most effectively accomplished through the rigorous application of the Risk Management Framework [SP 800-37](#482e4c99-9dc4-41ad-bba8-0f3f0032c1f8) and supporting security standards and guidelines."
