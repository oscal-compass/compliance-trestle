The program management (PM) controls described in this section are implemented at the organization level and not directed at individual information systems. The PM controls have been designed to facilitate organizational compliance with applicable federal laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. The controls are independent of [FIPS 200](#599fb53d-5041-444e-a7fe-640d6d30ad05) impact levels and, therefore, are not associated with the control baselines described in [SP 800-53B](#46d9e201-840e-440e-987c-2c773333c752).\n\nOrganizations document program management controls in the information security and privacy program plans. The organization-wide information security program plan (see [PM-1](#pm-1)) and privacy program plan (see [PM-18](#pm-18)) supplement system security and privacy plans (see [PL-2](#pl-2)) developed for organizational information systems. Together, the system security and privacy plans for the individual information systems and the information security and privacy program plans cover the totality of security and privacy controls employed by the organization."
